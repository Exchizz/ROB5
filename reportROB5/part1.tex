All rooms in the map must be checked in order to find cups. The robot must be within 2 meters of a cup in order to actually detect the cup and within 1 meter in order to collect it. Cups are marked in the map using one pixel with grayscale value 150. Cups can be offloadet at the two offloading stations in the cantina. The offloading stations are represented with pixel values 100. The robot must start and end at an offloading station.\\[0.2cm]
