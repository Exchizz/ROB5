\section{Coverage}
\label{sec::coverage}
The Dean feels that it is not economically justified to by a robot system for 80.000 euro just to collect cups. Hence, it is interesting to have the robot do a second task, namely washing of the floors. Therefore calculate a coverage path that covers most of the floor in the map. Again the robot must start and end at the offloading stations.\\[0.2cm]
Again, you are free to choose algorithm and you should document the choice, the distance in kilometres that the robot moves and how long it takes to compute the coverage path.
